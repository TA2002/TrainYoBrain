Nowadays a great amount of students of 6th grade are eager get into Nazarbayev Intellectual Schools(NIS), BIL, 
NurOrda and other prestigious schools.In fact, students have to pass logical tests and get necessary points. 
However, most of them do not succeed in these tests. We think that this issue is actual today, 
because parents spend a lot of money to prepare their children for the exams. So, we made a mini research on 
this problem and it turned out that the average score in logical section is 80 out of 135, therefore we 
decided to resolve actual issue by developing an educative and free software for children. 
The aim of the project is to improve memory, speed and logic of a child. 
The application was written using C# and Python(with “Pygame” module). 
There are many puzzle collection sites and applications, but “TrainYoBrain” has unique set of exercises 
which focus on getting into prestigious schools and improves mind skills alongside with language.
